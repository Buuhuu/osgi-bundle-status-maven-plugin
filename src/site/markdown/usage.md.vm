$symbol_pound$symbol_pound Usage

By default, the specified OSGi bundles are checked for status "Active", but
any bundle state can be specified.  If multiple bundle names are provided,
the plugin execution will succeed only if all named bundles match the
expected status.

Define the plugin in your project's `pom.xml` as follows:

        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>

                    <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>

                            <goals>

                            </goals>
                            <configuration>

                            </configuration>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
        [...]
    </project>

By default, the plugin is executed in the `install` phase of the build
lifecycle to ensure that a bundle has been successfully installed to an
OSGi container.

    mvn install
